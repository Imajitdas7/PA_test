user_interactions.csv: Contains data on user interactions with the website, including page views, clicks, time spent on each page, and user IDs.
purchase_data.csv: Includes information on product purchases, such as purchase timestamp, product ID, transaction amount, and user IDs.
website_performance.csv: Provides website performance metrics like page load time, bounce rate, and conversion rate for specific time periods.
Tasks to Complete:
Data Exploration and Cleaning:
Load and explore each dataset to identify missing values, outliers, or any data quality issues.
Perform necessary data cleaning and preprocessing.
User Behavior Analysis:
Analyze user interactions to identify the most visited pages and the average time spent on each page.
Determine the click-through rate for different sections of the website (e.g., homepage, product categories).
Create visualizations to present your findings effectively.
Purchase Analysis:
Calculate the overall conversion rate for the website based on purchase data.
Identify the top-selling products and product categories.
Explore the relationship between the number of interactions on the website and the likelihood of a purchase.
Cohort Analysis:
Perform a cohort analysis based on user sign-up dates to understand user retention and behavior over time.
Determine the lifetime value (LTV) of customers acquired during different time periods.
Website Performance Optimization:
Analyze website performance metrics to identify areas for improvement.
Propose strategies to reduce bounce rate and improve the conversion rate.
Create a visualization dashboard to monitor website performance in real-time.


Step 1: Data Exploration and Cleaning

Load each dataset (user_interactions.csv, purchase_data.csv, website_performance.csv) into pandas DataFrames.
Check for missing values and handle them appropriately (e.g., fill missing values, drop rows/columns with missing data).
Identify and handle outliers in the data as necessary.
Convert data types if needed (e.g., timestamps, numeric values).
Merge relevant information from the datasets to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
Step 2: User Behavior Analysis

Calculate the total page views and average time spent on each page based on user interactions.
Determine the click-through rate for different sections of the website by dividing the number of clicks by the number of page views for each section.
Create visualizations such as bar charts or pie charts to present the most visited pages, average time spent, and click-through rates.
Step 3: Purchase Analysis

Calculate the overall conversion rate by dividing the number of purchases by the total number of unique users.
Identify the top-selling products and product categories based on the purchase data.
Explore the relationship between the number of interactions on the website and the likelihood of a purchase using correlation analysis or other relevant techniques.
Step 4: Cohort Analysis

Extract the user sign-up dates from the user interactions dataset and perform cohort analysis.
Calculate user retention rates for different cohorts over time.
Determine the lifetime value (LTV) of customers acquired during different time periods by analyzing their purchasing behavior over time.
Step 5: Website Performance Optimization

Analyze website performance metrics like page load time, bounce rate, and conversion rate from the website_performance.csv dataset.
Identify areas for improvement by comparing performance metrics across different time periods.
Propose strategies to reduce bounce rate and improve the conversion rate based on the insights gained from the analysis.
Step 6: Visualization Dashboard

Create an interactive dashboard using tools like Plotly or Dash to monitor website performance in real-time.
Include visualizations from the previous steps to present key metrics and insights in a user-friendly manner.
Implement features that allow users to filter data and visualize performance metrics for specific time periods or sections of the website.
